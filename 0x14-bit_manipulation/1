# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

## Description

This project focuses on bit manipulation in the C programming language. The goal is to understand how to use bitwise operators and perform low-level operations using binary representations. This knowledge is crucial for systems programming, embedded systems, and optimizing code performance.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain, without the help of Google:

- How to look for the right source of information independently
- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C:
  - `&` (AND)
  - `|` (OR)
  - `^` (XOR)
  - `<<` (left shift)
  - `>>` (right shift)
- How to convert binary to unsigned integers
- How bit manipulation can optimize performance or memory usage

## Requirements

- Code is written using **vi**, **vim**, or **emacs**
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with:
